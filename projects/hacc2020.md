<a href="https://hacc.hawaii.gov/" target="_blank">Hawaii Annual Coding Challenge</a> is a hackathon that encourages innovation of technological challenges in the State of Hawaii. The hackathon is conceived by Governor David Ige in 2015 and it is a multi-week competition that allows for the participants to communicate and work together with the challengers. The hackathon provides a wide array of challenges from all sorts of department in challenges. For it's fifth year, there were 6 challenges this year with multiple sponsors, such as Transform Hawaii Government, Microsoft etc.

For the hackathon, I was fortunate to serve as the team captain for ByteCryb. The team consisted for Jennifer Hsu, Ken Tung, Trey Sumida, Arlsan Rakhmankulov and myself. We took on the Hawaii State Archive challenge that look to explore the possibility of gamifying the indexing process. Hawaii State Archive has a lot of things that needed to be indexed and there are volunteers that does help out with the process. This process currently consists of opening a bunch of tabs on a PDF viewer and an excel sheet. It takes a lot of tabbing between all the opened applications and tabs to complete each entry. There are also no validations for the values entered into each record. We also implemented roles such as rookie, indexer, proofer and archivist. 

To improve the workflow, we aimed to removed all the applications needed to do indexing process and also implement a bounty system to motivate one job over another if so desired by the archivists. We also added in a leaderboard that shows the daily, weekly, month, yearly and all time.

The team was split into two separate groups. Jennifer and Arslan worked on the frontend of the web application. Ken, Trey and myself worked on the backend of the application. I was put in charge with the ability to upload PDF, XML, records and profile pictures. I also helped create a method to checkout records that needs to be indexed so that multiple indexers can't work on the same record and create conflicting inputs. Since all of my work was on the backend, there was a lot of miscommunication that happened with the frontend concerning the endpoints that were needed. We tried to use Swagger to document them but no one beside me had experience with it and we had enough new things to learn so we moved on without. We should have used it since it would have made the development process much easier. The documentation could have also generated the JavaScript needed to access the end points without the frontend programmers having to figure out if things need to be sent as a form-data, set path variable etc.

The competition really forced me to get out of my comfort zone in telling people to deliver goals on time. I also learned new tools such as hibernate and spring boot. I was very hesitant to use external image API and storage since in practice that would bring up the overall cost of the project. So we tried to make an application that was very cheap to run and maintain. All the software we used were open-sourced, even the Java used to run the backend is OpenJDK and not the one by Oracle. I learned about the differences in. I also learn to get familiar with Digital Ocean and even Azure when I had to play around with them to find the best hosting solution for the backend. If I were to do this competition again in the future, I would try to be more experimental with the tools we choose even if the tools are not quite what the requirement of the challlenge suggests.
