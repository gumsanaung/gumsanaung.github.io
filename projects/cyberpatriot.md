  CyberPatriot is a National Youth Cyber Education Program centered on a cyber defense competition. During my junior year, I was approached by the Kaimuki High School JROTC to see If I would be interested in competition. I accepted the invitation and was put into a team of 5 members named “Bulldogs” with Mark Nelson, who at the time was a graduate student at UH Manoa, as our mentor. I did not know anything about how computer operated internally before but slowly over time, the team learned to trace packages, configure an entire network and eliminate vulnerabilities embedded into different images of different operating systems. The competition had different tiers and divisions. Silver, Gold, and Platinum were the tiers and the divisions composed of Open Service, All Service and Middle School. We competed for 2 years until we graduated high school. We made first place of gold tier in Hawaii for All Service division during the first year and made second place of platinum tier in Hawaii for All Service division. 

## Network Security Challenge
  We were given an image of Ubuntu and Windows 8 for the Gold tier and then an image of Windows Server 2016 was added when we made it into the Platinum tier the year after. The images came with vulnerabilities that when fixed would be reported to a central scoring server. We were given 6 hours to solve as many of the flaws as well as security questions in the form of text files in each image. I specialized in the Ubuntu images and jumped between multiple images to help other members.

## Cisco Networking Challenge

  This was perhaps the hardest part of the competition we have every came across. The challenge has many virtual routers, switches and servers that needed to link up to recreate a scenario provided by the competition. We had to use command lines to switch interfaces and to test that each network was configured correctly. The challenge was also required to be completed in the 6 hours provided for the security challenges. I really enjoyed all the experiences and fun I had with my team. I would say that this is one of few reasons why I became intrigued in studying computer science.
