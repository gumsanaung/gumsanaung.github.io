  Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) is a program that I really needed in high school that also guided me to where I am now. This program gave me many opportunities in pursing my dream of becoming a first generation college student in America. The story of how I got into this program was also the beginning of Go Green Committee. The committee started as a creation between me and a few other friends. Some of the friends were already in the program and I had just gotten around to knowing them. I moved to Kaimuki High School during my sophomore year from Iowa and did not know how I could fit into the new environment. 

  One of the things I noticed when I first came to the school was the large mural at the STEM Academy building. It was a beautiful piece of work, but I also noticed that there was little to no work being done to the large lawn next to the mural. The grasses were all dry and the trees all unhealthy. This led to a conversation with the AVID program teacher, Bill Spradlin, and the creation of the committee. We watered the grass, named the place “The Great Lawn”, planted new trees and shrubs, and cleaned the trash. The committee worked together with AVID, its parent program, thorough the years and the lawn has continued to leave a beautiful impression at the school.
