For the time I've spent using JavaScript so far, I am really enticed by what this programming language has to offer. As a new computer science undergraduate, the language comes off very easy and straight to the point. I think this language is very good for people who are starting out in programming. Many of the syntax and structure, such as scopes of variable, are like other programming languages. 

##FLEXIBILITY

In languages like Java, programmers must create a new class and make sure that all the right libraries. To run the class, a person must either create a main class or program a JUnit test to check that their code even works. In JavaScript, the code can be directly written in without the extra preparations.

This ability to create functions fast gives JavaScript an advantage when it come to athletic software engineering, which essentially comes down to having the ability to code fast. 

The language also integrates very well with HTML and CSS. This makes JavaScript especially useful for creating an online interface for programs that may be written in other languages. It can help create intuitive and beautiful websites that takes people a step farther in their click-to-redirect links etc. 

##ACCESS

JavaScript is very easy to access since it can run on any web browsers. Tools such as JSFiddle can be used to start programming right away. Downloading a programming software and setting up the environment are both entirely avoided.
