UI Frameworks are very different from what I imagined it to be. I thought they would make my programming easier but that is not the case at all. A framework are better to be seen as a bunch of pre-made methods that you can use. It is like giving an bush to a printer to use instead of a hair. In the end, you still have to paint the canvas with it. It makes getting things done a bit faster but it does not mean that the task is any less complex.

Frameworks, such as Semantic UI, do however make it easier to do a bit more fancy website than a pain text website. The tools available can speed up how to add interactive link and images. I think this is a lot better than having to create a unique CSS selector for every single non-plain text element you want to add for a website. This means that learning a new programming language is easier to start off if you have more tools to complete the tasks you want. It we did not have UI Frameworks, each programmer would need to have their own set of tools that they created instead a commonly used standard.
