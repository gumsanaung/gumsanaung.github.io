UI Frameworks are very different from what I imagined it to be. I thought they would make my programming easier but that is not the case at all. It is better to see a framework as a mixture of pre-made tools that you can use. It is like giving a bush to a printer to use instead of a hair. In the end, you still must paint the canvas with it. It makes getting things done a bit faster, but it does not mean that the task is finished within a few steps. I do feel the complexities of the task does decrease a lot once a framework is mastered since there is no need to build the tools that a framework provides. 

### Just like hardware tools
Frameworks, such as Semantic UI, do however make it easier to do a bit fancier website than a pain text website. The tools available can speed up the process of updating and/or adding new interactive links and images. I think this is a lot better than having to create a unique CSS selector for every single non-plain text element you want to add for a website. Even when you want to do something that the framework does not have a tool for, it is easier to build the new method using the basic tools. This means that learning a new programming language is easier to start off if you have more tools to complete the tasks you want. It we did not have UI Frameworks; each programmer would need to have their own set of tools that they created instead a commonly used standard.
