 I am a firm believer of a saying that “there are no such things as stupid questions and that stupid questions are the ones you do not ask.” However, I also do believe that you should not ask questions without any contexts or put out a query for ones for which an answer already exists. These simple, yet elegant, principles also happen to be the basis in Eric Steven Raymond’s How To Ask Questions The Smart Way. 
Most of the people on sites like Stack Overflow are volunteers and they have their own schedule. This means that they can not spend a lot of time trying to answer the questions on the site. It is a very good idea then to provide only relevant and precise detail of the problem and ask for comments of advice for that section. This skill to ask a question effectively will be of great benefit when you go into your professional career, especially as a “smart” software developer. 

## Examples:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54338168/js-jquery-replace-inner-text-without-destroy-event

This question is a good example of what a “smart” question should be. The user explained portions of his code that worked and what did not along with the precise variables that were causing a problem. The thread was also organized with a nice description of a problem and a code snippet followed by a rough idea of the user’s understanding of how the code should work. Instead of leaving a question for other users to answer, the thread asked for advices about ways to resolve the issue. The post was resolved very fast under 23 total views since upload. This mean that other users found this user’s thread interesting and worth the effort to help and that really make this question a “smart” question.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54339785/how-to-get-books-cover-through-isbn-number-in-oracle-apex-application-5

This thread, on the other hand, was downvoted multiple time, a signal of a “not smart” question, and showed that the user did not post any information of use for other users to get started with. There was no attempt to do the actual problem and all the question only asked to provide the full code. The question seems to be a searchable web result, or a light read through the manual of the program that problem is based on.

## Personal Reflection

After review Eric S. Raymond’s guide, I am reinforced to the idea of using online websites like Stack Overflow as a place of guidance, rather than a place for straight forward answers, and became aware of the qualities that makes a “smart” question. I learned not only to write “smart” questions but also develop an idea of the characteristics that distinguish them.
