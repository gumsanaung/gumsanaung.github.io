### OVERVIEW
Problem:

As students takes new classes, they needs new supplies. The cost of which are extremely high to buy from bookstore and online retailers. 

Solution:

This project provides a place where students casually sell their items that they no longer need but others may find useful. 

Description:

This website will feature the basic buy and sell features with the ability to categorized by departments, recommends items to buy, make feedback for purchases with rating system and sorting by cost, ratings, quality, alphabetically. The website is also created to only allow UH students to buy and sell. This means that student who uses this website must have a valid UH student number. The website will also allow students to sell their notes for specific classes that does not violate academic honesty, such as direct materials from a test, quiz, homework and etc.

### PAGE IDEAS

The likely pages for this project are:

### Case Ideas

New User ---> Sign Up ---> Browse Items

Users ---> Log In ---> Sell Items

Users ---> Buy Items ---> Rank Experience ---> Read Other Reviews

### ADVANCED FEATURES
The users will use have log in to even view the inventory and if we have any changes for advanced features, we will try to 
- use the UH CAS Login so that student can be directly verified as a UH student
- have the ability read some materials online in e-book format
- implement recommending sections for more things to consider buying
