As students takes new classes, they needs new supplies. The cost of which are extremely high and that is where this project tries to help. It provides a place where students casually sell their items that they no longer need but others may need. This website will feature the basic buy and sell features with the ability to categorized by departments, recommends items to buy, make feedback for purchases with rating system and sorting by cost, ratings, quality, alphabetically. The website is also created to only allow UH students to buy and sell. This means that student who uses this website must have a valid UH student number. The website will also allow students to sell their notes for specific classes that does not violate academic honesty, such as direct materials from a test, quiz, homework and etc.

Users will be instructed on how to use the website via a built-in web page. The likely pages for this project are:
Landing Page
Selling Page
Buying Page
Search Page
Rating Page
Profile Page

The users will use have log in to even view the inventory and if we have any changes for advanced features, we will try to use the UH CAS Login so that student can be also verified as UH student or even read some materials online in e-book format with recommending sections for more things to consider buying.
