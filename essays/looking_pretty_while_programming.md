Even though I started to code very recently, the last two years or so, I have always had a hard time trying to stay consistent with the way I code. Sometimes I would have to look back at older file to see what kind of style I used. I would sometimes have extra lines, miss indentations, fails to keep external libraries organized etc. Therefore, I believe that coding standards are a must for programmers. It helps, not only yourself, but also other people that needs to read over the code. It makes collaborations easier and efficient. It gives structure to what would otherwise be free flowing lines of texts.

One way of getting used to a coding standard for me has been using ESLint with IntelliJ. It is not a bad experience. I felt that I was getting hang of the standard easily since ESLint was pointing out pretty much every one of my mistakes. The tips that I get to correct my errors were very useful albeit sometimes it can be very vague. It should be very easy for people to get use to. There are also many online posts for pretty much any errors. It also helps makes sure the variables are declared within the right scope and even defined. The only problems it would be able to handle are the ones that happens after you run the code, which helps narrow down your search as you debug. The process of linting is awesome for productivity and it should be a basic part of all programmerâ€™s toolset.
