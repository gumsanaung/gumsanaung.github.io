### Design Patterns

Having looked at pseudo code to implement functions, you are inadvertently following a solution that someone made for a problem. They help you get the right answer to the problem with efficiency and most important of all, saves you from coming up with a new way of getting the solution yourself. The template helps cutting down the development time and most of the time, if not all the time, the solution you get from following the template is correct. It comes in many forms some conceptual and others very real and implemented. 

The structure of a program is also greatly influenced by this pattern. It decides how information is distributed, handled and changed. There might come a time when using a single source of information might be better than having individual sources but whatever the problem maybe, each can be addressed using their own effective template. The templates are usually formalized to their best representation because the better templates are used more often. 

### Invisible Influences
These templates are formally recognized and named as "Design Patterns". You probably follow them and not even realized how it works. When dealing with a multiple classes that have similar traits, I would write an abstract class that all my implemented classes would follow. The resulting classes would be able to do somethings together but maybe customized with other functions that makes them a bit more unique and effective for the problem I am trying to tackle. One of the biggest influence of design influence is the way I could pick up other programming languages with a little bit of practice because they are somewhat similar. The languages are sometimes very different on their own but they do allow you to create the same program at the end of everything.
