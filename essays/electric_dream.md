whenever I think of computer science, I have always thought of working with something like the image above. They were big, making robotic sounds and blinking lights. My first few memories of computer programming were all from tv series like Criminal Minds, which are not very accurate like all other tv shows about computer. Now I am enrolled in Univeristy of Hawaii at Manoa pursuing a bachelor of science for Computer Science and studying for it has not been the same I imagined as a kid. It is a lot slower than anything I have see but the varieties in the field makes me feel excited for it as I did when I first saw the character Penelope Garcia from Crimal Minds hack into her own servers at FBI.

I am currently learning the basics of computer programming but I hope to learn about high performance computing, parallel programming and artificial inteligence.
