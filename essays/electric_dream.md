whenever I think of computer science, I have always thought of working with something like the image above. They were big, making robotic sounds and blinking lights. My first few memories of computer programming were all from tv series like Criminal Minds, which are not very accurate like all other tv shows about computer. Now I am enrolled in University of Hawaii at Manoa pursuing a bachelor of science for Computer Science and studying for it has not been the same I imagined as a kid. It is a lot slower than anything I have seen but the varieties in the field and its potential makes me feel excited as I did when I saw the character Penelope Garcia from Criminal Minds hack into her own servers. That scene was just hilarious.


### interests
As I continue to study CS, I hope to learn about high performance computing, parallel programming and artificial intelligence. Creating a large sorted database that is directed by multiple artificial intelligences to find connections in data provided is a dream I hope to achieve in the future. Like Jarvis from Iron Man, I am interested in a system that compliment that curiosity of people in exploring the frontier of new advancements in technology.

### Reflection
The classes for my main interests are becoming closer but I still feel that I am lacking in skills and toolsets that I am experienced with. I am not sure about creating or managing databases, configuring networks, using command lines effectively, and other languages besides Java and JavaScript. Beside the skills that I lack, I have not interned at any place related to computer science. These are a few of the main things I hope to tackle in the future. My dream may be very big and optimistic but I am more than happy to start off small to achieve as much of it as I can.
